    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I barely graduated high school with a 1.83 GPA. I believe that is a 'D+' and I am proud of that plus. I ended up
      doing better in college. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor of Science degree
      in Biology with a 3.62 GPA. I was accepted into graduate school for a Physician Assistant program. I completed two
      semesters of my clinical didactic education before getting kicked out. I am also proud to have been kicked out of
      graduate school! It is was led me to find my niche.</p>
    <h3>Employment</h3>
    <p>I worked various jobs in healthcare prior to attending graduate school</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pharmacy Assistant at Kaiser Permanente</li>
      <li>Physical Therapy Aide at various physical therapy clinics</li>
      <li>Also served in the Army National Guard as a Cavalry Scout</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>My main goal at the moment is to become a great developer. I currently am nowhere near that goal but I look
      forward to putting in the work and taking on that challenge. I also want to make sure that no one else struggles
      as much as I did when learning how to code, so I'll be happy to help anyone in our cohort in whatever capacity I
      can.</p>
